              Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in
              Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war
              on hunger.

          that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the
          demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
          inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants
          and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people
          were selecting the best breeds."
